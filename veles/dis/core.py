class IsaParseResult:
    """
    Represents a disassembly result and intermediate states.  Has the following
    fields:

    - iw: a dictionary mapping bundle fields (IsaField instances)
      to their values, as parsed from the bundle.  Only fields that have
      actually been read are present here.  IsaSubField instances are not
      included here - they compute their values on the fly instead.
    - iwmask: like iw, but maps fields to masks of bits that have been
      successfully read from the bundle.
    - iwrm: like iw, but maps fields to masks of bits that have actually been
      used while decoding the bundle.  If bits are lit in iwmask, but not
      here, the bundle has unused fields (and it's suspicious if they are
      in non-default state, ie. usually non-0).  If bits are lit here, but not
      in iwmask, something went wrong while parsing the bundle, or there's
      a bug in the disassembler.
    - errors: a list of errors encountered while parsing this bundle (these
      are all instances of Exception subclasses).
    - len: length of the parsed bundle, in code bytes.
    - desync: a bool flag that is set if bundle parser cannot successfully
      determine where the bundle ends - if this happens, len represents
      the point where the parser gave up, and is mostly meaningless.
    - base: an expression representing the beginning of the code section this
      bundle resides in - passed straight from the dissassembler caller.
      If None, the instruction position is considered to be absolute.
    - anchors: a dictionary with ``base``-relative addresses of "points of
      interest" in the bundle - 'start' is mapped to the beginning of the
      bundle before parsing starts, and parsers can define further anchors
      as necessary.  This is mostly used to decode PC-relative arguments.
    - insns: a list of decoded instructions in this bundle (ie. IsaSTInsn
      instances).
